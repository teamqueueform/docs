## What is QueueForm?

QueueForm is a viral form builder designed to help teams collect leads, build waitlists, run giveaways, and grow audiences faster than traditional form tools.

Unlike static forms that only collect data, QueueForm turns every signup into an opportunity for viral growth by enabling built-in referral mechanics and reward systems.

Each participant receives a unique referral link, encouraging organic sharing and compounding reach without additional marketing spend.

QueueForm is fully no-code and built for founders, marketers, creators, and product teams.

## How QueueForm Works

QueueForm is built around three core ideas:

1. Capture interest using forms and waitlists
2. Incentivize sharing through referrals and rewards
3. Track and grow using real-time analytics

Every campaign functions as a growth loop where users invite others, move up ranks, and unlock rewards.
